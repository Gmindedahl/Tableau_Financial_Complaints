# Financial Complaints Dashboard Project


## [View Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/FinancialComplaintsDashboard_16862518224370/FCDashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)


This project showcases some vizualization techniques in Tableau. The dataset used in this dashboard is from [data.world](https://data.world/) and consists of financial conflict and resolution data. 

The visualizations showcased in this dashboard can be done natively in Tableau Public, except for the 'Complaints by State' visualization, which required a hex map import, and the hexagon shape to be added to the tableau repository. I will go ahead and add the hex map excel file and the hexagon image in this repo. <br><br>

Matt Chambers has a good guide on hex tile maps in Tableau, which helped clear up some issues i had when creating the hex tile map. Guide linked [here](https://www.sirvizalot.com/2015/11/hex-tile-maps-in-tableau.html)
